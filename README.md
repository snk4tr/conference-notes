# Conference Notes

This repository is a collection of my notes from the conference that I managed to attend. Feel free to both ask me questions on the content of the presentations and let me know if there are typos or misunderstandings from my side. 

You can compile source files on your own or directly get precompiled version of notes from following conferences:
