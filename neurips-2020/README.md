# 2020 Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems

This document contains notes I took during the events I managed to make it to at [NeurIPS 2020](https://nips.cc/). Please feel free to distribute it and shoot me an email if you find any typos or other items that need correcting.

Some papers have extensive descriptions and some not. It tells nothing about the level of importance of the ideas nor on the level of a paper. It is only a matter of my personal preference, which also is influenced by many other factors. The review is also very biased towards inverse problems in imaging and in medical imaging in particular because this is what I do.
